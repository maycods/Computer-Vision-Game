# Dodge game - Chicken Escape 🐔🦊

It is a computer vision based game where players guide a chicken 🐔 through obstacles 🌳 and dodge fox enemies 🦊 using real-time color detection. The character's movements are controlled by shifting the position of a green object detected by the camera. Aadding to that a Kalman Filter for predicting the position of the object when it's not on the screen anymore.

But before accessing the game, a menu is displayed containing various tools like image processing filters implemented without using predefined functions, as well as an "Invisibility Cloak" and a "Green Screen" using object color detection.
